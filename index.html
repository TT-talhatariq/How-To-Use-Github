            To be very crisp about what exactly is GitHub, it is a file or
            code-sharing service to collaborate with different people.

            GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version
            control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on
            a project.

            <span class="red">Example: </span> A software developer team wants
            to build a website and everyone has to update their codes
            simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github
            helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can
            upload, edit, and manage the code files.

        <h2>Benefits of GitHub</h2>
        <p>
          <li>It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects</li>
          <li>
            By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation
          </li>
          <li>
            Are you a developer and wishes to attract recruiters? GitHub is the
            best tool you can rely on for this.
          </li>
          <li>
            When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep
            track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are
            stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all
            the changes that have been pushed to the repository.
